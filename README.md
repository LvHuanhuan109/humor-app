# Humor Detection 

Deployed a Humor Detection Web App using [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) where users can input a sentence and a [fastText](https://fasttext.cc/) model will predict if the user inputted sentence is humorous or not.

The model was trained on this [data](https://www.kaggle.com/moradnejad/200k-short-texts-for-humor-detection).
